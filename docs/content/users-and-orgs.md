# Users and organizations

Side-Eye is designed for teams of people (although you can certainly use it by
yourself). As such, individual users belong to organizations, and snapshots are
accessible to the whole organization. Agents report processes on behalf of an
organization (agents are configured with an organization-wide API token), and
all the configuration pertains to the whole organization: the program labeling
rules that control what processes to monitor, and the spec controlling what data
to collect in a snapshot and how to organize it.

An organization corresponds to an email domain: if you sign in using a Google
account with the email andrei@mycorp.com, you belong to the mycorp.com
organization. Some popular domains are recognized as not corresponding to
organizations ("gmail.com", "hotmail.com", "yahoo.com", "aol.com",
"outlook.com", "icloud.com", "protonmail.com", "tutanota.com", "comcast.net");
signing in with such an email address means you won't share data with anyone
else.

After signing in, you can click on the user avatar image in the header to see
what organization you are part of.
